Revision history for DBIx-Table-TestDataGenerator

0.005 2013-01-XXXXX

    - Support for auto-increment primary key columns added.

    - One can now configure if for a self-reference, new root nodes should have NULL or their own primary key value as the value for the column referencing the parent record.

    - The generated test data can now be dumped to a csv file with bulk inserts in mind.

    - Fixes in license information and documentation.

    - Another bigger refactoring: The old TableProbe class was way too big. It has been replaced by smaller classes with definite responsibilities.

    - A big refactoring has been done, the module is now based on DBIx::Class for all database related things, in particular it does not contain DBMS specific code apart from DBD::SQLite, which is used to define in-memory databases to allow running tests during the installation of the module.

    - Currently, there is no seed functionality since for random selection of records we now use DBIx::Class::Helper::ResultSet::Random and for the time being no seed can be configured there.
