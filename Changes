Revision history for DBIx-Table-TestDataGenerator

0.004    xxth December 2012

    A big refactoring has been done, the module is now based on DBIx::Class for all database related things, in particular it does not contain DBMS specific code apart from DBD::SQLite, which is used to define in-memory databases to allow running tests during the installation of the module.
    
    Currently, there is no seed functionality since for random selection of records we now use DBIx::Class::Helper::ResultSet::Random and for the time being no seed can be configured there.
